# Hi, I'm Bryndell

- 👋 As a Hardware Design Engineer, I translate product specifications into detailed designs, oversee manufacturing processes , ensure quality control, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and manage the entire product development lifecycle
     from initial design to final mass production, bringing innovative hardware solutions to market efficiently and
     cost-effectively.
- 👀 I'm passionate about electronics and maintain a home laboratory for experimenting with various components and devices.
     This setup enables me to explore electrical systems and circuitry firsthand.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
    -> Zephyr app development based on nRF5340 from nordic semiconductors
    -> Building my text editor using neovim and lua
    -> Advancing my programming knowledge on both python, C and soon enough Rust.
- 💞️ I'm seeking collaboration opportunities for developing the Zephyr app using the nRF5340 and ESP32 platforms in IoT
     projects.
- 📫 Seeking counsel or simply wishing to exchange pleasantries? I'm here to assist and delighted to engage in a brief
     conversation.

***Have a good day!***
